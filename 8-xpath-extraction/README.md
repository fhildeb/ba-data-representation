# XPath XML Data Extraction

XPath, short for XML Path Language, is a powerful and expressive language designed for navigating, searching, and extracting data from XML documents. It allows users to pinpoint specific parts of an XML document by specifying conditions, such as element or attribute values, and manipulate the retrieved data efficiently. XPath expressions can be employed to select individual nodes, collections of nodes, or even specific values within an XML document.

XML data extraction is the process of parsing and retrieving relevant information from XML documents, which are structured and hierarchical in nature. By leveraging languages like XPath, developers can effectively query XML data and extract the required information with ease. This process is crucial for numerous applications, such as data integration, data transformation, and data analysis.

## XPathTester (Main)

This project demonstrates how to use XPath queries with the DOM4J library to extract specific information from an XML file. The XPathTester class reads an XML document and evaluates an XPath expression to select nodes from the XML file. The program then iterates through the resulting nodes, identifying their types, names, and values, and outputs this information in a human-readable format.

### Terminal Output

```
Demo XPathTester
1. Elementknoten<kuerzel> Wert = [[Niedermeier 05]]
2. Elementknoten<titel> Wert = [Java und XML]
3. Elementknoten<autoren> Wert = [Niedermeier, St.; Scholz, M.]
4. Elementknoten<verlag> Wert = [Galileo Press Bonn]
