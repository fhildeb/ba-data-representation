# XML Document Creation and Integration

In this session, XML basics were explored by creating well-formed and validated XML documents. It included generating a valid XML document and defining an internal DTD to ensure a more secure structure for applications to work with. Using XML Lint from the command line, the validation of XML documentscan be checked through parsers.

## Library

The example data features a example book library with an external book list.
The library incorporates external data from an existing book collection, distributing data maintenance across multiple sources. The DTD was extended with an ENTITY declaration and adjusted the XML-Prolog attribute to process external documents.

By inserting the book list entity into the XML library, the parser resolved the external file's content, seamlessly integrating it into the main document.
