## Course Contents

This course about data representation in software engineering delved into the various aspects of data and information. The course explored the semantics, content, syntax, structural, and presentation aspects of data, ensuring a thorough understanding of data management and manipulation. Participants were introduced to XML Specifications and Document Type Definitions, their correlated elements and processing instructions, while also learning about namespaces and schema variation.

Regarding the more practical part, the course provided insights into programming interfaces such as the Document Object Model (DOM) and Simple API for XML (SAX). It featured JSON structures, RESTful web service concepts. The course also covered version management using Git, XPath, and XSLT, emphasizing their relevance in XML technology.
