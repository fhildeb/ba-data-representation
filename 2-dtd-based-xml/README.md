# DTD-Based XML Validation

This project focused on creating and testing Document Type Definitions for validating XML documents using a measured value test report example. A generated XML contains measurement reports for an Enterprise resource planning system's incoming goods inspections. The document is refined iteratively.

Subtasks included creating an XML file with sample data, developing an internal DTD, converting it into an external DTD, and using an internal parameter entity. With the help of XMLLint, DTDs were tested, ensuring error-free validation. A second measurement report with varying data to the XML file was implemented and tested using the DTD.
