# XSLT XML-to-HTML Transformation

XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) is a powerful, declarative language designed for transforming XML documents into other formats, such as HTML, plain text, or even other XML formats.

## SimpleTransformer (Main)

This Java project demonstrates a simple implementation of an XML-to-HTML transformation using the XSLT standard. The program leverages Apache Xalan, a widely-used XSLT processor, to perform the transformation.

The transformer reads an input XML file and an XSL stylesheet to transform the XML content into an HTML file. The transformed HTML output is saved to a specified path.

> The project has two different data sets to choose from: address book or link list. By default, it reads and writes the HTML based on the address book.

### Terminal Output

```
